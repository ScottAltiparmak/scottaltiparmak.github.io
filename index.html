    <p>Hi, my name is Scott. I'm a 20 year old student, learning the ropes of developing, so far I haven't found my favourite type of development. 
        I don't really have a focus point at all yet. However I enjoy honing my programming skills, and have just started to focus on a bit of modelling and animation too.</p>
